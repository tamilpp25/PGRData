I should note that there is a 1.32% possibility that Babylonia might look into relevant liabilities on the matter. In the case of such a scenario arising, I have prepared a report on possible loopholes, as well as a justifiability analysis on the standards of BRRR and the relevant data to support the analysis.\\nI have also repaired the destroyed CIC holo-display last night. Depending on the investigation process, you may abstain from submitting the damage report.\\n...On an unrelated note, according to Nanami's testimony and the relevant files in Babylonia's database, I have learned that today is, according to the archaic cultural customs from an Eastern country with a long history and vibrant culture, what the people of that culture call \"Lunar New Year\".\\nIn the past year, we went through countless battles and choices together.

You said the beginning of memory was worth commemorating, but then you immediately stopped and apologized... Bambinata can't help but wonder if that has brought you any trouble.\\nYou said that you didn't want Bambinata to feel uncomfortable about your language... but Bambinata won't feel uncomfortable about the memory loss as long as Mistress and you are around. B-but... Bambinata could forget your birthday without the memory data. Bambinata doesn't want to miss your birthday... After all, Mistress said that this was the first time someone celebrated Bambinata's Activation Date, so Bambinata has to celebrate yours! So Bambinata has prepared this gift as an early birthday present for you, Commandant...

        "Content": "An Exclusive Interview About the \"Prismatic Trace\" Exhibition | Ayla: Exploring All Colors in Each Other's Eyes (Abstract)\\n\\nDecember 15th, Babylonia News \u2014 \"Prismatic Trace\" made a stunning debut in section C-06 of the latest modern art exhibition. Created by Ayla, one of Babylonia's most renowned rising artists, this exhibition features captivating, diverse visual elements that present the experiences and encounters of different individuals in the Reconquista Age. It has been extremely well received, with the number of viewers reaching an all-time high over all the past exhibitions.\\nOur reporter learned that all the works displayed in \"Prismatic Trace\" were completed by a joint effort between the WGAA and Task Force. Miss Ayla also agreed to an exclusive interview to share her ideas and experiences during the creation of this exhibition.\\n\\nQ: Can you share with us the reason for choosing this theme?\\n\\n\"Art seems to have become a lot less significant in this era, which actually drives artists to think further... To me, this blue planet itself makes the vastest and most brilliant canvas. It has different colors in everyone's eyes: some see it as cheerfully bright, while others think it's gloomy and dim... That makes me want to portray the worlds in different people's eyes in various forms, because everyone can interpret 'reality' in distinct ways.\"\\n\\nQ: We feel that every piece of work displayed is highly impressive. There is even a \"recreate\" device next to each of them that allows the viewers to understand how they were created. Why did you choose this format?\\n\\n\"It came from my recent experience during a battle on the surface. As for the recreate device... I want to give special thanks to a person who helped me a lot during the creation of this exhibition. That person is my muse and has always supported me whenever I feel confused and lost despite not realizing it... They have always been fighting for humanity's future, and I'd like to record their battle stories and portray the world in their eyes because their presence always brings us immense spiritual strength.\"\\n\\nQ: We have noticed that you named the empty canvas at the end of the exhibition \"Masterpiece\". Some say the name comes from the belief that your \"most satisfied work\" is always the next incomplete one. What do you think about that?\\n\\n\"Haha... I like that interpretation! Personally, I take pride in every work that I put my heart into! Hmm... Actually, I just had an idea of what I should draw on that one, and I can't wait to make it happen!\"\\n\\nQ: (Laughs) Is that what you call \"Eureka\"? Could you give us a little hint about your new work then? Not just me, I believe your fans are all curious about the true look of this \"masterpiece\" in your heart.\\n\\n\"Well, at least for now, it's still a girl's secret! Besides... It does take a lot of courage...\"",

Will you be my model and help me fulfill this wish?\\nI know you would ask why would I keep drawing you after having done so many of your portraits already? Hmm...

While Lucia and I were preparing the refreshments for our little gathering last night, I decided to hide a lucky coin in one of the snacks. It is said that finding such a coin brings blessings of happiness and joy for the entire year. I thought it would be a pleasant surprise for whoever discovered it, and surprisingly, I ended up being the one...\\n\\nBeing together with everyone in Gray Raven already makes me feel incredibly fortunate, so I'm wondering if you can help me by keeping this lucky coin safe.\\n\\nYou often remind me to lean on others instead of shouldering all burdens alone. So, perhaps you can consider this my first \"selfish wish\" in the new year. Please accept this lucky coin, and may it rid you of all hardships and help you achieve your desires. If any adversity occurs, I believe the united strength of Gray Raven will prevail. This is my New Year resolution\u2014one that I wish to accomplish with all of you.\\n\\nBy the way, the weather has been exceptionally cold these days. I know the indoors are warmer, but please make sure to bundle up before venturing outside, won't you? (Consider this another one of my \"selfish wishes,\" if you will.)\\n\\nCommandant, I'm certain that with you at our helm, Gray Raven will experience an even greater year ahead. You can always count on me to be by your side, ready to assist you whenever you need me.",

They spent every day running around, solving dangerous cases like helping a teddy bear find its lost nose, or finding the doll princess's arm that was thrown to the other side of the castle. \\nAlthough the little puppet was highly respected, over time, it began to feel somewhat tired. Its shiny armor became tattered from never-ending missions, and its eyes lost their luster. It could not help but wonder what the world outside would be like? The puppet secretly made a decision to go out of the castle after completing its duty.\\nHowever, the little puppet's dream never came true, for a sudden disaster destroyed everything. An evil giant took control of all the residents, turning them into horrible monsters.\\nThe puppet stumbled out of the castle, only to see a terrifying view\u2014outside the castle, there was no wilderness and ocean that it once longed for. Instead, all it saw was enormous backboards that enclosed the castle. Countless lifeless, badly wounded little puppets that looked just like itself lay under the backboards.\\nOn top of the puppet remains, it saw a treasure chest with \"Reality\" written on it.\\nAfter falling many times, the little puppet finally crawled to the chest. It slowly removed its lid, only to find there was no \"Reality\" inside, but an old, yellowed note.\\nTrembling in its final moment, it began to read the note\u2014\\n\"Dear Gray Raven Commandant, you are invited to the Activation Date Carnival...\"\\n...\\n...\\nWhat, lost your patience already?

The fluttering snowflakes and hazy glow of the streetlights stirred something in me. For no reason, I stopped under a streetlight and looked back. Through the light from the windows, I saw you standing up, stretching.\\n\\nIt took me some time to realize that I had too much fun and forgot to help tidy up the room. I was about to turn back when another thought came to me. Even though we are so close, we do not spend all the time together. No one can, of course. But still, I could not help but wonder what you had been doing when we were apart. Once the curiosity started, I could not stop thinking.\\n\\nAre you eating on time and getting enough rest? Do you feel lonely and want someone to talk to? Do you... think of me?\\n\\nI'm not writing this down to seek your answer. I want to let you know that while we are away from each other, I have kept our promises and done my best to take care of myself.\\n\\nI want you to see a better version of me every time we reunite, and I hope that in every reunion, I can see a healthy, happy Commandant.\\n\\nIt turns out I lied\u2014I wanted more than simple, peaceful everyday life. I find myself greedily yearning for more.\\n\\nI want to apologize, but at the same time, I'm secretly hoping that if I make more demands of you, perhaps you will also ask more of me in return.

He is delighted to have received the greetings from the Gray Raven Commandant, especially since it was not just a superficial group message. While your habit of catering to everyone's feelings is indeed admirable, you should not always neglect yourself because you care too about those around you.\\n\\nAs the already overworked commandant of Gray Raven, your only task during this precious holiday is to rest and unwind your mind. For example, you can watch the performance you talked about on New Year's Eve, enjoy the snowy scenery you mentioned on the first day of the new year, or continue with the shopping trip you discussed with Lucia and Liv yesterday.\\n\\nAlthough I can probably guess what choice you will make, I have already prepared the car and made a restaurant reservation, so it will not be a problem even if you have other plans.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, I am a little surprised to see that this year, you have learned how to turn down some meaningless social invitations during this holiday, which is great. While you may not have fully overcome the habit of forcing yourself to meet others' expectations, at least you have started to leave some time for yourself. So leave all other miscellaneous tasks to me, and spend your well-deserved holiday at your own pace and enjoy it however you like.\\n\\nAnother year has passed so quickly before I realized it. In this new year, I hope you and Gray Raven can continue to grow better in life and in every other aspect.\\n\\nHappy New Year, Commandant.",

That was a lot of food!\\n\"When life can be lost easily, it's quite cruel to celebrate for surviving another year, so we hardly celebrate birthdays anymore. But on this very day last year, you helped us set up this camp with your fleet. Turns out, what seemed like a selfish ritual can actually be shared with others. Thank you.\" \\nAfter saying this, he pulled a multifunctional can opener from his bag and handed it to me. In a time when any piece of scrap metal can be used as a can opener, I understand how precious this little tool can be. (The letter ends here abruptly)\\nWhile confirming the work schedule, I realized today is my Activation Date and recalled my days back in the fleet, so I wanted to share this story with you. I'm heading down to the surface soon to escort supplies. I can't keep the transport team waiting for too long, so I dug up this page from my old diary. Hope you don't mind. P.S. Thinking about it now, the flashing lights did look a lot like candles in the dim background, haha.",
