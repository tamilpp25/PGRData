The Kowloong temple fair is truly unique.\\nThis place is bustling like the busiest market along the Arctic Route and warm like the bonfire lit up by the Forest Guard. I once patrolled the depths of the forest, and even the starlight I saw there was not as brilliant as these lanterns, not to mention that we designed them all. This day will forever remain in my memory.\\nEven the most extravagant wishes seem within reach in such brilliance.\\nI hope that luck will stay with me in the new year. Happy New Year, Commandant.
